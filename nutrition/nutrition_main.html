					The biggest part of getting into shape is getting your eating habbits better.
					Eating a good amount of carbs, protein and healthy fats will go a long way.
				</p>
				<h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
				<p>
					Carbohydrates are your body's preferred fuel source. 
					You want every gram of carbohydrate you consume to be utilized as an immediate fuel source.
					Don't eat more carbs than you need, as getting too much carbs will result in the extra energy being stored as fat.
				</p>
				<h2>Protein</h2>
				<p>
					Protein is the main nutrient that your muscles need to heal and grow. Your body needs protein to repair damaged muscle fibres from workouts
					and is overall necessary for your body to function at its best.
				</p>
				<p>
					The best amount of protein that is recommended to consume is about a gram of protein per pound of body weight. 
					Any more protein might not be absorbed as your body can only take in so much, as opposed to fats and carbs which can be stored.
				</p>
				<h2>Fats</h2>
				<p>
					Fat are an essential part of our diet and is important for good health. 
					There are different types of fats, with some fats being healthier than others. 
					It is important to eat unsaturated fats in small amounts as part of a balanced diet.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fats also act as a source of energy, but gets absorbed much slower than carbs.
					Fats can act as an alternate source of energy for the day so you dont have to rely on carbs too much.
